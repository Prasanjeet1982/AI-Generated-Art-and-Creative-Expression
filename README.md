# AI Art Generation Project

This project demonstrates AI-generated art using the Progressive Growing of GANs (PGGAN) technique. The project includes code for training a PGGAN model and serving the generated art using a FastAPI web application.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up and run the AI art generation application on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Docker (optional, for containerization)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-art-generation.git
   cd ai-art-generation
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage

1. Train the PGGAN model (Optional):

   If you want to train the PGGAN model, you need to provide your dataset in the `data` directory. Edit the paths and parameters in `train.py` according to your dataset and preferences. Run the following command to start training:

   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```

2. Start the FastAPI web application:

   To run the FastAPI application that serves the generated art, use the following command:

   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
   ```

   Visit `http://localhost:8000` in your web browser to view the generated AI art.

3. Access the AI Art

   Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8000` to see the AI-generated art.

### Docker (Optional)

If you prefer to run the application in a Docker container, follow these steps:

1. Build the Docker image:

   ```bash
   docker build -t ai-art-generator .
   ```

2. Run the Docker container:

   ```bash
   docker run -d -p 8000:8000 ai-art-generator
   ```

   Access the application by visiting `http://localhost:8000` in your web browser.
